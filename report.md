## Introduction

This metabolomic project started in March 2022, and at this point it was asked to think about a project to do during the following weeks. The first thing was to decide which plants to study, and to find a precise aim and angle. In the end, it was decided to investigate 6 smelly plants, divided in two groups, each composed of 3 plants. The first group consisted of Allium ursinum, Allium insubricum and Allium fistulosum from the Amaryllidaceae family, and the second one of Mentha x piperita, Melissa officinalis and Lavandula angustifolia, which are part of the Lamiaceae family. One of the main goals of the project was to investigate if these two families of plants were chemically correlated one with another, and to see if the metabolites produced by the plants were more similar among one family than between the two. Furthermore, a second aim of the project was to study which extraction and analysis method was the best for the investigation of our plants' metabolites. 
Lamiaceae are known to produce a large and varied amount of essential oils, which are used in the pharmaceutical industry as well as in traditional and modern medicine. The main interest on these compounds is reposed on their antifungal, antibacterial, cytotoxic and antioxidant activities[^1]. Mentha L. species are of particular interest for their production of active compounds mainly from the monoterpenoids - found in essential oils - and phenolic compounds classes. The essential oils composition is highly variable within Mentha L. species and are known to have antimicrobial, antispasmodic, carminative, antiviral and antioxidant activities. The interesting activity of phenolic compounds is mainly due to specific lipophilic flavonoid, which have antioxidant, antiulcer, cytoprotective, hepatoprotective, chemopreventive, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetogenic activities[^2]. On the other side, Amaryllidaceae are known to be medicinally active and thus are important for the pharmaceutical industry, thanks to the production of pharmaceutically active alkaloids (mainly galanthamine and lycorine). One of the most important activities of these alkaloids is their anti-acetylcholinesterase activity, and are therefore used as Alzheimer's disease treatments[^3]. Regarding the first purpose of this work, it was expected to find some of compounds listed above for the two groups of plants and to see a correlation between the families or within the families. Regarding the second purpose of the project, i.e. the analysis of the best extraction and analysis method, liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS-MS) is known to be generally able to identify and measure a broader range of compounds with minimal sample preparation compared to gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Thus, we expected to be able to see different types of compounds with varying quantities using the two different protocols[^4].



## Material & Methods
In this subchapter, the material and the methods used during this project are listed and explained in detail. Methods are reported in chronological order, from the sample collection until the data analysis.

### Sample collection

The samples were collected in the botanical garden of Fribourg, on the 13th of April 2022. The precise location of the collection of each sample is represented in the following picture, showing the 6 precise places. Furthermore, the specific links for the iNaturalist page of each collected plant are reported under the locations picture.

Regarding the collection method, some leaves of each plant were cut with a scalpel (as shown in the figure below) and immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen, in order to freeze the cells without breaking them and to shut down the metabolic pathways as quickly as possible. The samples were then stored at -80°C until the preparation of the samples.

### Sample preparation

The frozen samples were taken out from the freezer and they were crumbled with scissors, to enable better extraction thanks to a bigger solvent-exposed surface. For each plant, it was decided to extract with three different solvents: heptane and dichloromethane for GC-MS samples, and methanol for LC-MS samples. Around 200 mg of crumbled plant tissue were weighed and put into a glass erlenmeyer flask to be then immediately covered with 20 mL of the given solvent; this procedure was used for all the samples and all the extraction solvents. In the following table the exact weighted masses for each sample are reported:

The erlenmeyers containing the solvents and the plant tissues were covered with an aluminium foil to avoid excessive evaporation, and were shaken overnight under the fume hood (samples shown in the picture below).

<img width="912" alt="Schermata 2022-06-01 alle 16 17 42" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103575088/171426440-2baaa292-a0aa-4515-8835-bcc4036e8ae4.png">




The extracted samples were then filtered with filter paper and put into small glass tubes, before being stored at -20°C until their injection. The day of the injection, the samples were set in specific LC or GC glass tubes and injected in the machine.

### LCMS Analysis

### Data treatment

Several softwares were used for the analysis: ProteoWizard, MZmine 2, Filezilla, GNPS and Cytoscape. ProteoWizard was used to convert the raw data files into mzML format, which is a format that can be read by MZmine 2. MZmine 2 is an open-source software for mass-spectrometry data processing, which has the main focus on LC-MS data[^5]. With a little more details, MZmine allowed us to build chromatograms out of our mzML files, in order to align the different features detected, so they could be used for further analysis. Once the aligned feature list was obtained, FileZilla was used to transfer this file, and the required metadata associated with it, into a server for the commons_lab-teaching. FileZilla is an open software multi-platform which allows the transfer of files online through the FTP protocol[^6]. GNPS (Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking) was then used to perform analysis tasks on these data that were transferred with FileZilla and accessed on GNPS through the commons_lab repository. GNPS is an open-access website for sharing of raw, processed, or annotated fragmentation mass spectrometry data (MS/MS). GNPS allows the identification and annotation of compounds, from initial data acquisition/analysis until post publication[^8]. From that, Cytoscape data was downloaded and put into Cytoscape. Cytoscape is an open source software, which allows the visualisation and annotation of entire molecular network[^7].

### MS1

Regarding GC-MS 70 features were identified, in contrast to the 247 of LC-MS, out of which 69 had structural identification. 

#### LC-MS

When analysing the number of compounds detected in the 6 different plants, it was observed that many more features were detected in the Lamiaceae family compared to the ones found in the Amaryllidaceae plants, as reported in the table below. While looking at the number of peaks which had structural identification, it was observed that a higher percentage of structural identification was found in plants of the Lamiaceae family compared to those found in the Amaryllidaceae family. Thus, the identification of compounds specifically produced by Amaryllidaceae was complicated and only partially successful, as reported below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103576860/172247670-d4326972-7dbe-49a9-9a63-0b7c001f1445.png)

When looking at the molecular network of our plants (found at the end of the results section), it was possible to observe that compounds of the plants from the two different groups were mainly clustered within the family rather than between the two families. The majority of common compounds between the two families were primary metabolites, such as glutamate, sucrose and others, which brought us to the hypothesis that the interesting produced compounds (such as secondary metabolites used in pharmaceutical or food industry) may be mainly shared within the same family rather than between the two families. Some interesting compounds have been chosen to be described for each family and each plant, and are represented below. They are accompanied by their mirror match spectrum (in black are the occurrences detected in our samples, while their green counterpart are the database correspondence of these occurrences) and their 2-D structure.

#### LAMIACEAE 

Some compounds were only found in the 3 plants of the Lamiaceae family but in none of the Amaryllidaceae ones. An example is caffeic acid, whose spectrum is represented below. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103576860/172247696-b3296e92-9e9b-4851-8b3b-dd09a8804384.png)

Caffeic acid is an hydroxycinnamic acid derivative and polyphenol, with potential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antineoplastic activities. This compound is known to be produced by a very wide range of species, including Allium fistulosum. However, in our Allium fistulosum sample it wasn’t detected[^9]. 


Mentha x piperita: Eucalyptol

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103576860/172247719-aab6373e-2372-4b55-9c48-c809b962abee.png)

Eucalyptol has been found in Mentha x piperita, and it's a monoterpenoid with a spicy, cooling taste which makes this compound used in the industry in flavorings, fragrances, and cosmetics. Eucalyptol has been used also used in traditional medicine as a cough suppressant. It is commonly found in the Eucalyptus genus of the Myrtaceae family. [^9].

Compounds specifically produced by each Lamiaceae plant have been investigated, the results are reported below. 

Since Mentha x piperita is known to produce a wide range of interesting medicinal compounds, it has been decided to represent and describe 3 compounds specifically produced by mint, the first one being eucalyptol, whose spectrum is represented below. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103576860/172247778-f9000650-286a-4cf4-b17b-9697caed8a10.png)

Eucalyptol is a monoterpenoid with a spicy, cooling taste which engendered this compound to be used in flavourings, fragrances, and cosmetics industries. Eucalyptol has been also used in traditional medicine as a cough suppressant. It is commonly found in the Eucalyptus genus of the Myrtaceae family [^10].

A second compound which has been found to be specifically produced by Mentha x piperita is gardenin B, represented below.

[<img width="470" alt="gardeninB" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103575088/169078454-9ec3eef1-49fb-454e-8f9b-80d7cc589eac.png">](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103575088/169078454-9ec3eef1-49fb-454e-8f9b-80d7cc589eac.png)

Gardenin B is a flavonoid lipid molecule (tetramethoxyflavone) being part of the phenolic compounds class. This compound is commonly found in mandarin, oranges, peppermint, sweet basil and other plants, making gardenin B a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products[^11]. Gardenin B is also known to be able to induce cell death in human leukaemia cells[^12].



A third and last compound which has been found to be specifically produced by Mentha x piperita is hesperidin.

[<img width="479" alt="hesperidin" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103575088/169078486-1f010162-18e1-433a-a1da-a50ea57c8f54.png">](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103575088/169078486-1f010162-18e1-433a-a1da-a50ea57c8f54.png)

Hesperidin is classified as a bioflavonoid, mainly known and used in medicine to help blood vessels function better (in case of haemorrhoids, varicose veins, and poor circulation) and to reduce inflammations. This compound is commonly found in citrus fruits[^13].

Within the compounds produced by Lavandula angustifolia, herniarin was found to be specifically produced, and its spectrum is reported below[^14].

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103576860/172245024-7b884629-5337-4354-8fb7-546bccb4a629.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103576860/172245024-7b884629-5337-4354-8fb7-546bccb4a629.png)

Herniarin is a natural chemical compound which is mainly found in species of the Prunus genus and it can be considered a methoxy derivative of coumarin or a methyl derivative of umbelliferone[^15]. This compound is known to have antispasmodic, antigenotoxic and antimicrobial (in presence of UV light) activities[^16]. 

Finally, the only identified compound specifically produced by Melissa officinalis was found to be salviaflaside, whose spectrum is represented below[^17].

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103576860/172247889-67f762c2-ced0-4643-9363-17cab072e87b.png)

Salviaflaside is a phenolic acid known to be produced in herbs and spices[^18]. Salviaflaside is known to have different interesting medical activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antiestrogenic, neuroprotective, and immunomodulatory activities[^19]. 

#### AMARYLLIDACEAE 

Regarding the Amaryllidaceae family, no compounds were identified in all three plants that were not commonly shared with the Lamiaceae family, but some were found in two out of the three Allium sp. None of these compounds, unfortunately, had any identification. It was therefore decided to look for a compound of interest within each plant. The results are reported below.


Regarding Allium ursinum, only D-fructose was found to be specifically produced. However, it was surprising that such a supposedly ubiquitous compound was found only in Allium ursinum and not in the other plants[^20].
![D-fructose_Allium_ursinum](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103576860/171428083-f36f1a51-2c2c-4113-9a9f-88841f26344c.png)

Some compounds were only found in Allium insubricum. However, since no match in the database was found, the description of the compounds and their properties was not possible. The same was found for Allium fistulosum.

Furthermore, as reported at the beginning of the results section, it was in general observed that Allium species not only had less features detected but also had poor identification of compound structures (lower percentages of identification). For this reason, the Amaryllidaceae are not described in detail. While looking at these feature detection results it was hypothesised that either Amaryllidaceae plants produce a lower amount of secondary metabolites than Lamiaceae plants, or that a better extraction method for this group needs to be investigated. In addition, the poor structural identification of the features of this family suggested that they are probably less studied and less extensively described plants than those of the Lamiaceae family. 


### Molecular Network

The following molecular networks were obtained with the Cytoscape software, with the data downloaded from the GNPS analysis of our LC data. 

The colour legend to our molecular network is reported here:

![LC_Colors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103575088/169083957-43d7d7c7-f745-44e7-aaa0-8f13541d2b83.png)


1 = Allium ursinum

2 = Lavandula angustifolia

3 = Melissa officinalis

4 = Mentha x peperita

5 = Allium insubricum

6 = Allium fistulosum

7 = blanc (methanol)


The following pictures represent the molecular network and some clusters of interest of the project

The picture reported below represents the overall Cytoscape network, without highlighting any relationship. It is possible to observe on the top part, the features that are related one to another, forming clusters (first two lines). On the bottom part the features that aren’t related to any other are represented. Later in the report, it will be possible to observe that most of the clusters belong to the Lamiaceae family, while almost none of the features detected from the Amaryllidaceae family were part of any cluster.
![LC_Cytoscape_Network](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103575088/169084570-eff543ba-5f11-4fcf-aa54-0ff78c3993db.png)

On the Allium fistulosum network (represented below), almost no clustering was detected, and the compounds shared with other species are either primary metabolites (i.e. sucrose), or had no identification.
![LC_Cytoscape_Network_Allium_fistulosum](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103575088/169084454-0cacd600-68a3-4d73-9d78-ac4e27c6d5d8.png)


The Allium insubricum network (represented in the figure below) was slightly richer than the A. fistulosum one, which is in line with its greater number of features detected. The overall profile of the network, however, is very similar to Allium fistulosum.
![LC_Cytoscape_Network_Allium_insubricum](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103575088/169084470-ab34eb35-b354-45e5-9696-9c02a264bf55.png)


Looking at the Allium ursinum network represented below, it was observed that the low number of features detected displays a similar profile as the two other Allium sp.
![LC_Cytoscape_Network_Allium_ursinum](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103575088/169084483-668fe150-7fcb-4b49-8f75-3955ebfb39bd.png)


The Lavandula angustifolia network (represented below) is the richest one, being part of almost all the biggest clusters, and composing the vast majority of the two upper middle clusters. This species had the highest number of features detected.
![LC_Cytoscape_Network_Lavandula_augustifolia](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103575088/169084499-db8aff8e-22cc-4ef4-a351-2e70cd04b626.png)


Melissa officinalis had, among the Lamiaceae plants, the lowest number of features detected, showing only 10 more features than Allium insubricum. However it displayed a better clustering profile, represented in the figure below. 
![LC_Cytoscape_Network_Melissa_officinalis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103575088/169084529-7ad57978-8ad4-4113-9909-3ca81129d08d.png)


Mentha x piperita had the highest percentage of identified peaks (as discussed above), despite not having much more features detected than Melissa officinalis. It was also observed that Mentha x piperita was part of a greater number of clusters than Melissa officinalis.
![LC_Cytoscape_Network_Mentha_x_piperita](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103575088/169084548-919b4f67-c60f-4386-84cd-9490334dec30.png)

Overall, these networks highlight in a more striking way what was already observed and discussed in the compound identification part of the results section. In fact, the networks showed that plants of the Lamiaceae family had more features detected compared to the Amaryllidaceae family, and that the detected features in the Lamiaceae group were more related one to another than the ones in the Amaryllideceae one. We observed a strong similarity between the chemical structures of the features among a cluster. 

For instance, on this zoom of the Mentha x piperita cluster (reported below), the two biggest circles, with mass equal to 155.1431 and 137.126 were identified as eucalyptol[^21] (C10H18O) and alpha-pinene[^22] (C10H16), respectively. These two molecules differ only by a H20 molecule (mass equal to 18), and their molecular weight is 1 higher than what we can find on PubChem. This is due to the ionisation technique used (Electro Spray Ionisation, or ESI), which protonates molecules.

![Cluster_alpha-pinene_eucalyptol](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103576860/172246518-72387bad-5658-4621-9c3c-90709d5763d6.png)

Since in plants of the Amaryllidaceae family less features were detected and identified, less clustering in the molecular network was also observed. 

#### GC-MS
Regarding the GC-MS analysis, which was made comparing two extraction solvents (dichloromethane and heptane), only a superficial analysis was made by looking at the spectra and at the list of the detected compounds. The spectra showed that the protocol for GC-MS, which differs from the LC-MS one for the extraction method and the analysis, seemed to allow a poorer detection of compounds by showing less peaks (70 features compared to 247). When looking at the features list within the same plant, it was noticed that the extraction solvent seemed to have an impact on the compounds detection, since between the two different solvents, differences were found. Heptane seemed in general to enable a better extraction of plant compounds, compared to dichloromethane. To be able to conclude which extraction and analysis method is the best for plant compounds characterization, it will be necessary to better and deeper investigate the GC-MS results and to make a detailed comparison between the protocols.  



## Conclusion
With regards to the method of analysis used on the 6 plants, and despite the only superficial analysis of the gas chromatography results, it appeared that LC-MS allows a wider compounds detection (observed both in the feature list and in the observation of the chromatograms), but a final conclusion regarding this aspect cannot be made until a more in-depth analysis will be carried out. Regarding the extraction method for gas chromatography analysis, the results showed a better extraction of compounds using heptane. Finally, regarding liquid chromatography results, a larger number of detected compounds was found in the Lamiaceae family compared to the Amaryllidaceae family, which could be due to either the lower production of molecules, or a worse ability of methanol to extract compounds from this family compared to the Lamiaceae. From the few compounds detected in plants of the Amaryllidaceae family, a low percentage has been structurally identified , making a detailed analysis difficult. However, for the Lamiaceae family it was possible to identify caffeic acid as a compound common to the three plants, in addition to the identification of at least one compound specifically produced by each of the three plants. It was interesting to see that many of these identified compounds had, as mentioned in the introduction, beneficial medical actions. Mentha x piperita was the most analysed plant, and was found to produce monoterpenoids and phenolic compounds, such as eucalyptol (monoterpenoid), gardenin B (tetramethoxyflavone, being part of the phenolic compounds class) and hesperidin (flavonoid, being part of the phenolic compounds class), as described in the introduction section. 
As a general conclusion, the results of this project showed that the extraction method and the analysis method seemed to have an influence on the compound detection, with LC which seems to be the best, and that a better correlation within a family was found than between the two. Finally, the results showed that metabolites from different families of plants need probably to be extracted through different methods in order to have a good detection of compounds, and that less studied families of plants make the structural identification of compounds more difficult. As a pioneer part of the Digital Botanical Garden Initiative, we hope this report will be of use to future researchers in order to help them identify the best protocols and analysis methods to fulfil this project.
