## Introduction

This project was started in March 2022, and at this point it was asked to think about a project to do during the following weeks. The first thing to do was to decide the plants to study, having a precise aim making the choice. Finally, it was decided to investigate 6 smelly plants, devided in two groups composed by 3 plants. The first group consisted on Allium ursinum, Allium insubricum and Allium fistulosum from the family of Amaryllidaceae and the second one on Mentha x piperita, Melissa officinalis and Lavandula angustifolia being part of the Lamiaceae family. One of the main aim of the project was to investigate if these two families of plants were correlated one with another, or if the metabolites produced by the plants were more similar among one family than between the two. Furthermore, a second aim of the project, was to study which extraction and analysis method was the best for our plants, trying to get a good protocol for future investigations. 
Lamiaceae are known to produce a large and varied amount of essential oils, which are used in the pharmaceutical industry as well as in traditional and modern medicine. The main interest on these compounds is reposed on their antifungal, antibacterial, cytotoxic and antioxidant activities[^1]. Mentha L. species are of particular interest for their production of active compounds mainly from the monoterpenoids in essential oils and phenolic compounds classes. The essential oils composition is higly variable within Mentha L. species and are known to have antimicrobial, antispasmodic, carminative, antiviral and antioxidant activities. The interesting activity of phenolic compounds is mainly due to specific lipophilic flavanoid, which have antioxidant, antiulcer, cytoprotective, heptoprotective, cholagogue, chemopreventive, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetogenic activities[^2]. In the other side, Amaryllidaceae are known to be medicinally active and thus be important for the pharmaceutical industry thanks to the production of pharmaceutically actives alkaloids (mainly galanthamine and lycorine). One of the most important activities of these alkaloids is their anti-acetylcholinesterase activity, being thus used for the Alzheimer’s disease treatment[^3]. Regarding the first purpose of this work, it was thus expected to find the compound listed abovefor the two groups. 
Regarding the second purpose of the project, being the analysis of the best extraction and analysis method, liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS-MS) is known be able to identify and measure a broader range of compounds compared to gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) with minimal sample preparation. Thus, regarding the second purpose, we expected to be able to see different types and amount of compounds using the two different protocols [^4]. 



## Material & Methods
In this subchapter, the material and the methods used during this project are listed and explained in detail. Methods are reported in chronological order, from the sample collection until the data analysis.  

### Sample collection
 

The samples were collected in the botanical garden of Fribourg, in date 13. 04. 2022. The precise location of the collection of each sample is represented in the following picture, showing the 6 precise places. Furthermore, the links reported under the picture represent the specific links for the iNaturalist page of each collected plant.

Regarding the collection method, some leaves of each plant were cutted with a cutter (as shown in the figure below) and immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen, to froze the cells without breaking them and to shut down the metabolitic pathways as soon as possible. The samples were then stored at -80°C until sample preparation.

### Sample preparation

The frozen samples were taken out from the freezer and they were crumbled with a cold scissor, to enable better extraction. For each plant, it was decided to extract with three different solvents: heptane and dichloromethane for samples for GC-MS analysis and methanol for samples for LC-MS analysis. Around 200 mg of crumbled plant tissue were weighed and putted into a glass erlenmeyer flask and immediately covered with 20 mL of the given solvent; this procedure was used for all the samples and all the extraction solvents. 
In the following table the exact weighted masses for each sample are reported:

The erlenmeyer containing the solvents and the plant tissues were covered with an aliuminium foil to avoid excessive evaporation and shaked overnight under the fume hood (samples represented in the figure below).

The extracted samples were then filtered with filter paper and putted into small glass tubes, before being putted at -20°C until sample injection.
The day of injection, the samples were putted in specific LC or GC glass tubes and injected in the machine.

#### LC-MS

Looking at the molecular network of our plants, it was possible to select some interesting metabolites which are represented below: 

Regarding the Lamiaceae family, it has been decided to represent one compound which has been found in 

Mentha x piperita: Eucalyptol

<img width="465" alt="eucalyptol" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103575088/169078425-c8e76817-19ce-415e-af5e-70a8df325a07.png">

Eucalyptol has been found in Mentha x piperita, and it's a monoterpenoid with a spicy, cooling taste which makes this compound used in the industry in flavorings, fragrances, and cosmetics. Eucalyptol has been used also used in traditional medicine as a cough suppressant. It is commonly found in the Eucalyptus genus of the Myrtaceae family. [^5].


Mentha x piperita: Gardenin B

<img width="470" alt="gardeninB" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103575088/169078454-9ec3eef1-49fb-454e-8f9b-80d7cc589eac.png">

Gardenin B has been found in Mentha x piperita, and it's a flavonoid lipid molecule (tetramethoxyflavone) being part of the phenolic compounds class. This compound is commonly found in mandarin orange, peppermint, sweet basil and other plants, making gardenin B  a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products [^6]. Gardenin B is also known to be able to induces cell death in human leukemia cells [^7]. 



Mentha x piperita: Hesperidin

<img width="479" alt="hesperidin" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103575088/169078486-1f010162-18e1-433a-a1da-a50ea57c8f54.png">

Hesperidin has been found in Mentha x piperita, and it's classified as bioflavonoid, mainly known and used in medicine to helps blood vessels function better (in case of hemorrhoids, varicose veins, and poor circulation) and to reduce inflammations. This compound is commonly found in citrus fruits [^8].




### Molecular Network
